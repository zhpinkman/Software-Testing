# Software-Testing
The aim of this repository is to gather all the projects I have done that fall under the Software Testing area. All of these projects were done as the part of the Software Testing course offered at the University of Tehran under the supervision of [Dr. Khamespanah](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~e.khamespanah)
